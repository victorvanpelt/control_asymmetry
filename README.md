## Asymmetric Adjustment of Control 
This repository contains all data and code used for the paper "[Asymmetric Adjustment of Control](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3507282)."
The research project was carried out by [Victor van Pelt](https://www.victorvanpelt.com).

### Data Collection
Using the [o-Tree software package](https://www.otree.org), I conducted the experiment at a research institute for economics and management of a large European university. Prior to running the experiment, I obtained approval to run the experiment from the research institute by submitting a research proposal. When participants arrived in the experimental lab of the research institute, participants waited briefly in a waiting room and plenary received some instructions before moving into the computer room (e.g., no talking, and no electronic devices). When entering the computer lab, participants randomly chose one cubicle containing a computer. Using our software, we randomized roles tied to cubicles in every experimental session.
